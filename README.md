# Ocean_front_detection
An ocean front detection algorithm written by myself.
Step 1. Use the prepossess.py to process SST and SSS data(Nc), and calculate the density data, save them in Numpy and Nc formats both.
Step 2. Use the main.py to detect the fronts, save the generated Numpy matrices.
Step 3. Use the statistic_analyses.py to analyze the results, plot the graphs, do some statistics, etc.
